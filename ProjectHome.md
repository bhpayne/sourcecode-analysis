Perl scripts for analyzing source code. Currently only Fortran 77 is supported.

Objectives:
  * Determine relations between main body, subroutines, and functions in a monolithic source code. Produce a graph these relations (using GraphViz).
  * For two sets of source code, compare changes for each subroutine and function.
